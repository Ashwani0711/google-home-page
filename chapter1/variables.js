// in js there are three variable type
var ashwani
let Kumar
const rathore='surname'
// var iand let in above case is used to declare a variable with preceeding name
//in const we declare a variable at the same time assign a value to that variable
//we use variable as a alias for the assigned value to that variable
//for standard it is recomended to use let or const type of variable
// variable name cannot start with number it is always alphabetical 

ashwani="007" //in ashwani variable we assign 007 as a string data type
Kumar=011 // in kumar variable we assign 011 as a number data type 
// rathore=099 
// in the above case we have assigned values to the declared variables
//we can not assign value to const type variable
